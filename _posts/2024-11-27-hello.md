We’re thrilled to announce the launch of LTNOG, a community-driven group dedicated to fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among network operators in Lithuania.

Our mission is to bring together professionals, enthusiasts, and stakeholders in the networking and telecommunications space to discuss best practices, tackle industry challenges, and drive innovation.

Whether you're managing ISPs, data centers, IXPs, or exploring cutting-edge technologies, LTNOG is here to connect you with like-minded peers and provide a platform to grow together.

Stay tuned for updates on upcoming events, and/or opportunities to engage. Let’s build a stronger networking community in Lithuania (or maybe Baltic states?)!

If you would like to join the community, be one of the crew members, [contact](/contact) us directly via e-mail or join our Discord server.

Let's roll!
