LTNOG (Lithuanian Network Operators Group) is a community of network operators, engineers, and professionals who work in ISPs, content providers, data centers, or other areas of the online and telecommunications industry in Lithuania. Founded in 2024, LTNOG was established to foster cooperation and the exchange of technical and operational knowledge among those involved in building and maintaining network infrastructures.

Our community organizes an annual conference to facilitate discussions on network operations, infrastructure, and emerging technologies. The annual LTNOG conference is a key event for the industry, offering a platform for sharing experiences, technical expertise, and insights without sales or marketing content.

The goal of the community is to build a strong community of engineers and network operators, promoting collaboration and mutual support to ensure the robust operation and growth of Internet infrastructure in Lithuania and its integration into the global Internet ecosystem.
